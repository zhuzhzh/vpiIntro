This directory contains the following files:
	test.v     -- a Verilog design file, module test
	pipe.v     -- a Verilog design file, module pipe
	getports.c -- the C source for function to traverse the Verilog hierarchy
	ncsim.log  -- ncsim log file containing the simulation results
	README     -- this file 
	run        -- the executable file to compile the Verilog design, elaborate, 
	              and simulate with dynamically linked shared library.
	irun_run   -- the executable file to compile the Verilog design, elaborate,
		      and simulate in one step, using the irun utility.

To run the example, type "irun_run" to simulate your Verilog design and VPI application,
or type "run" at the prompt after you compile the C source into a shared library getports.so.
